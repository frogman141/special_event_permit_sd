# Exploring Data: City of San Diego's Special Event Permitting

All of the hype around Data Science and Machine Learning primarily revolve around the break through's of Neural Networks and Deep Learning. While, yet these are just a small number of modeling alogrithms and they fail to expose you to what Data Science is all about. Extracting knowledge out of data. How do you extract knowledge out of data? Well that's complicated. It starts though by Exploring your data.

I've collected some about Special Event Permitting in the City of San Diego from [San Diego's Open Data Portal](https://data.sandiego.gov). This data contains all of the events that required a special event permit from 04/2016 to 04/2018. 


## The Challenge:

The first step you to working on this project is to conduct and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The aim of an EDA is to get develop a high level intution of your data. You start by asking and answering general questions. Moving towards more specific questions as you go along.

Let's say you just got a job from the City of San Diego as a Data Scientist. First day on the job they give you access to the Special Event Permitting database. Your first project is to assess the impact special events have on the city. First questions you need to answer are:


- What type of events are considered special events?  
- What are the most common types of special events?
- What is the geographic distribution of Special Events?
- What other questions do you need to ask?
